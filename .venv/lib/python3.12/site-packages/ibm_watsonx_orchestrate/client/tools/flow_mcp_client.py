            4. Returns immediately with count of pending elicitations
            5. Asynchronously regenerates and sends elicitation requests for each pending task
            6. Tracks sent elicitations to prevent duplicates to the same session
            7. Client receives elicitations and can respond normally
        
        Key Features:
            - Non-Blocking: Returns immediately, doesn't wait for replay to complete
            - Idempotent: Can be called multiple times safely (deterministic elicitation IDs prevent duplicates)
            - Duplicate Prevention: Tracks which elicitations have been sent to each session
            - Resilient: If client disconnects during replay, can call again to retry
            - Background Processing: Replay happens asynchronously without blocking the caller
        
        Use Cases:
            1. After Reconnection: Client disconnected and missed elicitation requests
            2. Server Restart: Flow server restarted while flow was waiting for user input
            3. Session Recovery: Recover from network interruptions without losing flow state

        Submit an elicitation response offline when the client was disconnected during an elicitation request.
        
        When a client disconnects during an active elicitation, they can reconnect and submit
        the response later using this tool. The tool looks up the original ON_TASK_WAIT event
        from the Redis stream and posts the response to the callback queue to resume the flow.
        
        Args:
            instance_id: The unique instance ID of the flow run
            elicitation_id: The elicitation ID from the original elicitation request (this is the task_id)
            response: The elicitation response with the following structure:
                - action (required): One of "accept", "decline", or "cancel"
                - content (optional): The form data content (required for "accept" action)
        
        Returns:
            Success message with elicitation ID and action taken, or error message if:
            - Flow instance not found
            - User not authorized
            - Flow already completed or failed
            - Elicitation not found or already resolved
        
        Authorization:
            User must have access to the flow
        
        Response Handling:
            | Response Type | Action         | Behavior |
            |--------------|----------------|----------|
            | Form         | Accept         | Posts form data with form_operation: 'submit'. Flow resumes. |
            | Form         | Cancel/Decline | Posts form_operation: 'cancel' with empty form_data. Flow handles cancellation. |
            | Non-Form     | Accept         | Posts callback content items. Flow resumes. |
            | Non-Form     | Cancel/Decline | Elicitation remains open - no callback posted. Returns can_retry: true. |
        
        Key Points:
            - Form cancellations are communicated to the flow engine via form_operation: 'cancel'
            - Non-form cancellations leave the elicitation open for retry
            - The tool validates that the elicitation is still pending before submission
        
        Workflow:
            1. Client disconnects during an active elicitation
            2. Client reconnects and calls subscribe_flow(instance_id)
            3. Client calls replay_flow_pending_elicitation(instance_id)
            4. Client submits response using submit_flow_elicitation
            5. Flow resumes processing with the submitted response
